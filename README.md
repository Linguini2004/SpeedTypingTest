# SpeedTypingTest
This is a speed typing test developed in python that measures the typing speed of the user. Note that in order to run this program you will need both -python 3- and the -pygame- module installed. In addition to this all files need to located in the same folder for them to run correctly.
Also note that there are some file directories within the code that are unique to my computer and so will need to be changed for anyone downloading this code.

This project was created for the Arkwright application.

Bugs:
- The only known bug that I am currently aware of is that if keys are spammed then the program will "lose its place" along the text.
I believe that this is a result of multiple key presses occuring in the same event loop.
